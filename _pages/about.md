<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a 3rd-year undergraduate at University of Hong Kong. My research interest lies in theoretical computer science, especially in approximate algorithms, discrete probability, and graph theory. 

I am very fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Weiming Feng](https://fwm94.github.io/).

Currently, I am looking for summer research opportunities in 2026 and PhD programs in 2027 fall.
